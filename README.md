# Developer's guide

## How to start?

The project is base on [ng-boilerplate][https://github.com/joshdmiller/ng-boilerplate].
To start working with it follow the install instructions from the site executing two commands below.

`npm install`
`bower install`

## Development workflow

Run `grunt watch`. It runs unit tests, minifies js and css and creates ready to deployment site in `/dist` folder.

## Typical issues

I had problems with compiling `less` files. I found solution [here][https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/issues/8088]
